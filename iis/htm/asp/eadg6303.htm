<P>New with Windows 2000, Component Services provides a number of services that make component and Web application development easier. These services include:</P>

<H5>Component Load Balancing</H5>

<P>Component Load Balancing is the process by which a server distributes the workload, generated by clients, among the available resources. A client application or web page passes a request to the Component Load Balancing (CLB) Server, which then acts as a router, directing the creation request to an available application server. Component Load Balancing can eliminate the need for the developer to manually control where object instances are created, allowing the system to select where they are run. For additional information, see Load Balancing in the Component Services section of the Platform SDK.</P>

<H5>Queued Components</H5>

<P>Queued Components allow you to create components that can execute immediately if the client and server are connected. They provide an easy way to invoke and execute components asynchronously, and in the event that the client and server are not connected, the component can hold execution until a connection is made. Queued Components assist the developer by using method calls similar to the calls used in component development, diminishing the need for an in-depth knowledge of marshaling. For more information, see Queued Components in the Component Services section of the Platform SDK.</P>

<H5>In-Memory Database Support</H5>

<P>The In-Memory Database (IMDB) is a transient, transactional database-style cache that resides in memory and provides extremely fast data access to data on the machine it resides on. It enables components to use the existing system-level OLE DB and application-level ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) API sets to create and access data. Using memory in this way provides more efficient caching for database applications that need to manage transient state. For additional information, see In-Memory Database in the Component Services section of the Platform SDK.</P>

<H5>Component Services Events</H5>

<P>Component Services Events allows publishers and subscribers to loosely connect so that they can be developed, deployed, and executed separately. The publisher need not know the number and location of the subscriber and the subscriber uses an intermediate broker to find a publisher and manage the subscription to it. The event system simplifies component and Web application development by allowing both publisher and subscriber identities to be persistent: publishers and subscribers can be manipulated without being known to each other.&nbsp; For more information, see COM+ Events in the Component Services section of the Platform SDK.</P>
